# Scroll Carousel
> pre-alpha not entirely working yet not released :)

Ongoing issues to fix & features to add
-------
##### Bugs
* ~~Padding on child elements breaks center & right alignment with & without box-sizing: border-box~~ **use jquery outerwidth to fix**
* Margins break alignments
* Indicator buttons are hardcoded to only work for left align atm
* Borders create minor offset issues, current working fix is a little hacky (add additional width of a couple pixels on some checks)

##### Features todo
* Extract API for passing custom button classes
* Dynamically add theme classes on instantiation
* Keep it as customizable as possible!
